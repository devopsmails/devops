What is Load Balencer?

/ A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and

capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. \

What is OSI Layers?

This model is called Open System Interconnection (OSI) 
because this model allows any two different systems to communicate regardless of their underlying architecture.

Advantages of OSI Model
