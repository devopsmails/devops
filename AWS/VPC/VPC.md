VPC
___________________

What is VPC and why it is used?

Virtual private clouds can be configured to tighten down security at the highest level. 
For instance, an organization can create virtualized replicas of access control features usually employed by traditional 
data centers. Like data center security, a VPC can control access to resources by IP address.
