Terraform = Infra Structure as a Code  
--------------------

Why Terraform?  
---------
To Provide service for one team it's fine to use directly ""AWS CONSOLE""
But if there are number of teams & project to support for infrastructure assistance It's quite hectic & time consuming.
Hence We use ""Programatic Approach using AWS API's""
Terraform is open source & provides best features in market in Providing ""AWS INFRASTRUCTURE""
