Why ingress is needed when Load Balancder service types exposes to outer world?
---------------------------------------------

Load balancer service type

The LoadBalancer service type creates a load balancer that distributes traffic across all of the instances of your service. This is a good option if you need to expose your service to the public internet and you need a high-availability solution.

However, the LoadBalancer service type is not available on all Kubernetes providers. Additionally, it can be expensive to create and maintain load balancers.

Ingress
---------

Ingress works by routing traffic from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. It provides a unified way to manage and route traffic to your applications, without having to manage services and load balancers manually.

Ingress is a good option if you need to expose your services to the public internet, but you don't need a high-availability solution. Additionally, Ingress is available on all Kubernetes providers.

Reasons to use Ingress instead of the LoadBalancer service type

Ingress is available on all Kubernetes providers, while the LoadBalancer service type is not.
Ingress is often cheaper to use than the LoadBalancer service type.
Ingress provides a unified way to manage and route traffic to your applications, without having to manage services and load balancers manually.
Here are some specific examples of when you might want to use Ingress instead of the LoadBalancer service type:

You are running a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider that does not support the LoadBalancer service type.
You are running a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider that charges for load balancers.
You need to expose multiple services to the public internet, but you don't need a high-availability solution for all of them.
You need to route traffic to your services based on complex rules, such as the host name, path, and HTTP method.


Ingress routing types:
========================
Host based routing
path Based routing
